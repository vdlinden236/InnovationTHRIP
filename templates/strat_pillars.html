						<p style="padding: 30px;"><strong style="color:orange">The Strategic Innovation Intent</strong> serves as the strategic driver for all innovation activities in the organisation. This pillar measures the extent to which innovation goals are defined and communicated within the organisation and therefore, serves to guide innovation value creation. </p>

						<p style="padding: 30px;"><strong style="color:orange">The Innovation Environment Management</strong> describes the ideal enabling environment for innovation, with specific focus on leadership and governance, as well as the ensuing organisational culture and climate (how ready is the “environment” for innovation?). </p>

						<p style="padding: 30px;"><strong style="color:orange">The Organisational Innovation Capability pillar</strong> focuses on the organisational and employee competence required to not only do the right things but to also do it right; employee competence should also be leveraged beyond only existing roles;</p>

						<p style="padding: 30px;"><strong style="color:orange">The Innovation Process Management pillar</strong> ensures that innovative ideas are properly managed and coached through the innovation process to the implementation thereof; this also serves to guide employees through the innovation process; defining the rules of engagement throughout the process of innovation in the organisation.</p>

						<p style="padding: 30px;"><strong style="color:orange">The Return on Innovation component</strong> measures the impact of innovation. It highlights the need to measure and capture the benefits of innovation in the organisation. The focus is on how value is captured, measured and communicated within the organisation? What is the value or benefit of implementing new ideas?
